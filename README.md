# Crowdfunding ETL Project

Background:

For the ETL mini project, we worked in a team to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Python/Pandas
    - DataFrame creation from Excel files.
    - Using string splitting to separate one column into many.
    - Renaming, reordering, and dropping columns.
    - Changing data types.
    - Changing dates from Unix epoch format to YYYY-MM-DD.
    - Exporting DataFrames to CSV.
- QuickDB
    - Entity relationship diagram (ERD) creation.
- PostgreSQL
    - Database and schema creation.
    - Importation of data to SQL tables from CSV files.

Resources:
- Utilized StackOverflow, prior class activities and assignments, and program documentation.
